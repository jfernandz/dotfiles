# 1.
# I've written two different versions, the commented version creates a patch every time I run this scipt. This is not 
# very useful because when upstream changes, the new patch created will cause the removal of updates coming from upstream
# because that new patch created would be created comparing my old version with the new from upstream. My old version would
# not have the updates from upstream, thus those updates will be removed again when the patch applies.

# 2.
# That's why I've created a static patch which will only modify the specific lines; that's not either a proper way because
# if some line moves or the new content of cloned raw scripts varies too much, the patch might fail (that's because I'm
# getting a backup in ./polybar-scripts_custom). In fact this `static_script.patch` file is by now included in the git repo 

# 3.
# The most proper approach to this issue would be to use `awk` or `sed` to parse the files and introduce the appropriate modifications
# in the new raw files, but I still cannot use `awk` or `sed` unfortunately.
